/* Camera Usage Description - REQUIRED */
"NSCameraUsageDescription" = "METAFIT uses the camera to capture photos of your meals and food. For example, when you take a photo of your lunch, our artificial intelligence automatically identifies the ingredients (such as rice, chicken, vegetables) and calculates the exact nutritional values: calories, proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. This allows you to track your daily diet and achieve your health and fitness goals simply and quickly.";

/* Photo Library Usage Description - REQUIRED */
"NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription" = "METAFIT needs access to your photo gallery so you can select images of meals you have previously taken.

/* Photo Library Add Usage Description - OPTIONAL */
"NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription" = "METAFIT can save photos of your meal analyses to your device's gallery. This allows you to keep a visual record of your analyzed meals for future reference and tracking of your nutritional progress over time.";
